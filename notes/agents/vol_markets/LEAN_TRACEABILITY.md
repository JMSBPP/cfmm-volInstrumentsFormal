# LEAN_TRACEABILITY.md — vol-instruments markdown ↔ Aristotle-proved Lean

**Master reference: `VOLATILITY_INSTRUMENTS.md`** (plank worktree,
`notes/VOLATILITY_INSTRUMENTS.md`; a copy ships in each Aristotle bundle).
Its claim-by-claim map is §7. The supporting reference documents are the
markdowns in this directory. This file maps
every claim in them to the machine-checked Lean layer
(`lean/vol_markets/*.lean`, mirrored at `JMSBPP/cfmm-lean4-spec`), and fixes
the shared notation. Statuses: **PROVEN** (sorry-free, axiom-clean:
`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound` only), **CORRECTED** (doc claim was
wrong; the true statement is proven), **REFUTED** (counterexample proven),
**OPEN** (not yet formalized).

## 0. Notation dictionary (single source of truth)

Reserved project-wide: **`η` is the pricing-kernel eta** (`model/exp/eta.md`,
`exp/eta.lean`). It is never reused. The fee paper's `η⁰`/`η¹` are mapped to
Latin names below.

**The η-identity outcome (recorded 2026-08-01, at exactly the strength the
fidelity record supports).** The user's 2026-07-31 decision that `priceEta`'s η
and `eta.md`'s η are the SAME parameter has TWO halves and only one of them is
proven. (i) The **exponent identity** `priceEta η Δi i = CFMM.Eta.p_eta lam Δi
(η/2) i = CFMM.Eta.P_half lam (Δi·η/2) i` is **PROVEN** — `priceEta_eq_p_eta_half`
and `priceEta_eq_P_half` in `EtaCurvature` (T28'a); the factor 2 is `priceEta`'s
sqrt-price normalization, and the statement is on integer ticks, the domain on
which the two conventions are comparable. (ii) The **factor-share identification**
— that this same η is the exponent of `CFMM.Eta.L_eta η X Y = X^η·Y^(1−η)`, the
weighted-CFMM trading function — is **OPEN** (ETA block E8(6); the optional T28'b
came back absent, as pre-authorized, and was NOT satisfied by restating T28'a).
**The user's decision is therefore PARTIALLY discharged, not closed.** The reason
the second half is a modelling claim rather than a rewriting is stated in
`exp/eta.lean`'s own `P_half` docstring: **η does not enter the tick→price map**,
so a reserve-side factor share cannot be read off a grid-side exponent by algebra.
E6 records further that the factor-share reading is not merely open but
*unavailable* wherever `η⋆ ∉ (0,1)` — at `λ = 1.0001, ϱ_I = 0.05, φ = 0.003` it
needs `Δi ≳ 21`, while `Δi = 1` and `Δi = 10` are both in standard use.

Three collisions with the MEV anchor (Milionis–Moallemi–Roughgarden,
arXiv:2305.14604v2) are resolved the same way, doc-side, and the resolutions are
binding: the anchor's fee `γ` is this document's `φ` (this document's `γ_j` stays
the sigmoid steepness); the anchor's Poisson block rate `λ` is written through its
own primitive `Δt ≜ λ⁻¹`, because this document's `λ` is a hazard rate; and the
anchor's composite `η ≜ γ√(2λ)/σ` is **deliberately never named** — the
root-block-rate factor is written `√(2/Δt)` throughout and no abbreviation is
introduced. Separately, `λ_ARB` and `λ_MEV` are **not interchangeable**: `λ_ARB`
is the arbitrage channel and a SUMMAND of `λ_MEV`, and no row below may substitute
one for the other.

**The curvature anchor's collisions (Capponi–Jia, arXiv:2103.08842v4 §5.1) are
resolved the same way, and the resolutions are binding.** His curvature index `k`
is REMAPPED to `κ_φ` (user amendment 2026-07-31; `χ` is rejected outright and
appears nowhere), his investor private-use premium `α` to `ϱ_I` and his price-shock
magnitude `β` to `ϱ_S`, because this document's `α_j`, `β_j`, `γ_j` are the `Θ_φ`
sigmoid parameters and are always subscripted. His Proposition-5 coefficients
`τ₁, τ₂, τ₃` are remapped to `c₁, c₂, c₃`, because `τ` is taken by `τ_MEV` (§9).
His probabilities `θ, κ_I, κ_com, κ₁, κ₂` are **ABSORBED and NEVER NAMED** — they
enter only through the four constants `ϖ_A, ϖ_I, ϖ_H, ϖ_D` — because `θ` collides
with this document's option theta and `κ` with the Phase-11 scalarization weight;
bare `κ` therefore stays FORBIDDEN and only the `\varphi`-subscripted forms are
admissible. His proportional trading fee `f` is **IDENTIFIED** with this document's
`φ` rather than renamed. **`η` is PROTECTED end-to-end** and was the REQUIRED
symbol of the ETA phase's notation gate — which **INVERTS** the Phase-11 gate's
Rule 1, where `η` was forbidden. `ν` was never introduced, because block M6b binds
it to `ν_t = w_t/D_t`.

Two standing distinctions in that layer, in the same voice as `λ_ARB` vs `λ_MEV`
above. First, **`EtaCurvature.arbLossRatio` and `MevOptimization.mevMulti` are NOT
IDENTIFIED** and no row below may substitute one for the other: they come from
different models — a two-period discrete-shock equilibrium against MMR's fast-block
diffusion — with different units, a per-period ratio of pool value against a
discrete hazard sum over `D_t`. Second, the **`λ` overload is deliberate and neither
usage was renamed**: in the ETA layer an unsubscripted `λ` inside an exponential is
the TICK BASE `PosSpec.lam = 1.0001`, while in `### MEV` every `λ` is a subscripted
hazard (`λ_ARB`, `λ_MEV`, `λ_FLAIR`, `λ̃_JIT`). Both are legitimate in their own
scope; a bare `λ` in an ETA display is never a hazard.

## 6. Not covered by any Lean module yet

- `exposure.md` — `VegaExposure`, `N_v = ΔM/p_vol(σ̄)`: the `p_vol` map should
  go through `VolInstrument.priceEta` (σ → tick → Q64.96). **OPEN.**
- `pos_spec.md` EVM type layer (u24/u16/u88 builders). **OPEN.**
- Integer/rounding quantification beyond `mulX96Down_*` (accumulated floor
  error over N positions). **OPEN.**
- The abstract `𝓖_φ` group beyond the `probOr` monoid core. **OPEN**, and it
  stays open regardless of the MEV work below. (`λ_FLAIR` is formalized and
  solved — see §7 / `FlairOptimization.lean`; the continuum path-integral
  form remains the limit of the proven discrete functional.)
- The MEV layer is **no longer unformalized**: `λ_ARB` and `λ_MEV` are proved in
  `MevOptimization.lean` and `MevJointProgram.lean` (§7). What remains **OPEN**
  there, named precisely rather than as a blanket:
  (a) the **continuum path-integral** form of `λ_ARB` — the discrete functional is
  the deliverable, exactly as for `λ_FLAIR`, and the continuum object is its limit;
  (b) the demand-elasticity / optimal-fee **equilibrium** layer, which belongs to
  `FeeSchedule` and whose exact missing term is the anchor's section 7.3 eq. (27),
  `E[delta-hedged LP P&L] = E[NT_FEE] − E[ARB]` — so every corner solution in §7 is
  a property of the formalized objective, not a market-equilibrium claim.
  **AMENDED 2026-08-02 (this gap now has a PARTIAL carrier; it is not closed).**
  Capponi's `ϱ_I` (`premInv`) IS a demand-side parameter of exactly the kind this
  item names — an investor private-use premium — and the ETA layer (§13) carries it
  in closed form all the way into the curvature optimum: `kphiStar_mem_Ioo_iff`
  makes the optimum interior precisely when `φ < ϱ_I`, and `etaStar` is a closed
  form in `(ϱ_I, φ, Δi)`. **WHAT IS NOW CARRIED:** a demand-side valuation premium
  entering an optimum in closed form, with the fee and the demand premium trading
  off explicitly (`etaStar_strictAnti_fee`, `etaStar_strictMono_premInv`).
  **WHAT REMAINS OPEN, and it is the larger half:** (b.1) the **equilibrium
  transfer** — that our tick-grid AMM actually HAS Capponi's closed forms with
  `curvIndex η Δi` in the curvature slot is an ASSUMPTION, not a derivation (ETA
  block E8(1)), so every ETA theorem is a statement about `lpExcess ∘ curvIndex`
  and none is a statement about this project's AMM; and (b.2) the **optimal-fee**
  half — MMR §7.3 eq. (27) itself, which the ETA layer does not touch. A real
  closure needs ONE objective carrying both a demand-elastic investor and `λ_ARB`;
  that object exists in neither model (E8(7));
  (c) the anchor's **Theorem 3 / Theorem 4 asymptotics themselves**, quoted in block
  M2 but formalized nowhere — `arb_add_fee_eq_lvr` is a bridge identity, not those
  theorems;
  (d) the **exact Corollary-2 CPMM kernel** of block M3(ii) (the optional T19 object
  ARBoverV_exact was omitted), which is the only carrier of the `σ²·Δt < 8` guard;
  (e) the σ-VARYING constrained comparison **restricted to `Θ_φ`-reachable
  schedules** — the general schedule-level claim is REFUTED
  (`mev_ge_flat_under_flair_budget_false`), but the isotone sub-family that `Θ_φ`
  actually reaches is not settled by that counterexample.

### 7.1 `### MEV` — the `λ_ARB` kernel, its infimum, and the `λ_MEV` aggregate

Blocks M0–M8 of the `### MEV` section (proposal copy:
`VOLATILITY_INSTRUMENTS_MEV_ADDENDUM.md`), anchored on Milionis–Moallemi–Roughgarden
arXiv:2305.14604v2. Modules: `MevOptimization.lean` (bundle A, run `cb371ee5`) and
`MevJointProgram.lean` (bundle B, run `19f777ab`). Notation per §0: the rows below are
about `λ_ARB` unless they name `mevTotal`.

| Doc claim | Lean | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M1 `P_trade(φ,σ,Δt) = σ/(σ + φ√(2/Δt))` with all seven asserted properties: range `(0,1]`, `=1 ⟺ φ=0`, strictly antitone in `φ`, **strictly convex** in `φ`, isotone in `Δt` and in `σ`, `→ 0` as `φ → ∞` | `MevOptimization.ptrade`; `ptrade_mem_Ioc`, `ptrade_eq_one_iff`, `ptrade_strictAntiOn`, `ptrade_strictConvexOn` (+ its named weakening `ptrade_convexOn`), `ptrade_monotoneOn_dt`, `ptrade_monotoneOn_sigma`, `ptrade_tendsto_atTop` | **PROVEN** — both strict forms returned strict; neither was downgraded |
| M2 the MMR split `ARB + FEE ≈ LVR` | `MevOptimization.arb_add_fee_eq_lvr` — a **bridge identity** and nothing more: the hypothesis-free ring **tautology** `x·p + x·(1−p) = x`, which lets the anchor's Theorem 3 / Theorem 4 split be *written* in Lean notation. It is **NOT a formalization of Theorem 3/4**, which are fast-block small-fee asymptotic approximations and are formalized nowhere in this phase (§6(c)) | **PROVEN** (as the identity only) |
| M3 discrete `λ_ARB = Σ_{t<T} P_trade(φ(σ_t),σ_t,Δt)·a_t/D_t`, over the SAME `multiFee` parameter space and the SAME denominator `D_t` as `flairHazard` (commensurable by construction); CPMM weight `a_t = (σ_t²/8)·V_t·Δt` | `MevOptimization.mevHazard`, `mevMulti`, `mevMulti_nonneg`, `mevWeight_cpmm_pos` (the `·Δt` factor is carried; the `σ²Δt < 8` guard correctly NOT attached at this tier) | **PROVEN** |
| M3(ii) the exact Corollary-2 CPMM kernel — the only object carrying `σ_t²·Δt < 8` | — (optional T19 omitted; no carrier anywhere in the repo) | **OPEN** — deliberately optional, non-blocking |
| M4 identification: antitone in `φ̄` (strict), in each `α_j` and in `u`; isotone in each `β_j` ⟹ `Θ_{λ_ARB} = {φ̄, α, u}`. There is **no affine** identification analogous to `flairMulti_affine` — `ptrade` is not affine, so level and shape do not separate and M5's bound is a path SUM, not a scalar × path weight | `MevOptimization.mevMulti_anti_phibar` (strict), `mevMulti_anti_alpha`, `mevMulti_anti_u`, `mevMulti_mono_beta`, `Theta_lambdaMEV_identification` | **PROVEN** — and the **no affine** finding corrects the naive FLAIR-mirror expectation (the doc itself already records it); a second place the mirror breaks, alongside M5's admissibility constraint |
| M5 the infimum program, solved: path-SUM lower bound at the fee ceiling; bang-bang attainment at the level-corner top for fixed shape; `β_j → −∞` saturation as a boundary value that is NOT a minimum; a STRICT gap at every finite `β`; a minimizer on any nonempty admissible compact box; that minimizer strictly exceeds the displayed bound | `MevOptimization.mevMulti_ge_corner`, `mevMulti_corner_attained_levels`, `mevMulti_saturation_limit`, `mevMulti_strict_above_saturation`, `mevMulti_exists_min_compact` (`ContinuousOn` PROVED, not assumed), `mevMulti_min_gt_corner` (at `u = uMax`) | **CORRECTED → PROVEN** — the saturation limit as specified was FALSE: without `0 ≤ φ̄max + umax·αmax0` the limiting fee lands on `ptrade`'s negative-fee pole. The same pole forces the admissibility constraint on the compact-box existence statement |
| M6a the DEGENERACY of the unconstrained joint program: one admissible point simultaneously maximizes `λ_FLAIR` and minimizes `λ_ARB` in the level block; both objectives saturate along the same direction `β_j → −∞`; and no scalarization `κ ≥ 0` repairs it | `MevJointProgram.joint_corner_degeneracy`, `joint_beta_degeneracy`, `joint_scalarization_degeneracy` | **PROVEN** — and the result **is** the degenerate one: unconstrained there is NO trade-off over `Θ_φ` and the shape block `(β, γ)` is NOT essential. The phase brief's "the shape block becomes essential" expectation is thereby REFUTED, machine-checked |
| M6b, budget half: a fixed FLAIR income pins the mean fee `B/W` and leaves the path shape free; the schedule ↔ path carriers agree definitionally | `MevJointProgram.flair_budget_pins_mean_fee`, `flair_budget_mean`, `flairPath`, `mevPath`, `flairPath_schedule`, `mevPath_schedule`, `flairPath_sum`, `flairPath_budget_mean` | **PROVEN** |
| M6b, constant-σ half: at `σ_t ≡ σ_0`, over arbitrary nonnegative fee PATHS at equal FLAIR income, the FLAT path minimizes `λ_ARB`, strictly so for any path non-constant on the positive-weight steps | `MevJointProgram.mev_ge_flat_under_flair_budget_const_sigma`, `mev_gt_flat_under_flair_budget_const_sigma` (consumes `ptrade_strictConvexOn`, the strict form) | **PROVEN** — at the PATH level and at CONSTANT volatility only; the aligned-measure hypothesis `a ≡ w` is imposed by substitution and is strong |
| M6b, general σ-VARYING **schedule**-level claim (`φfun : ℝ → ℝ` arbitrary subject only to `0 ≤ φfun(σ_t)`): "the flat path is at most the tilted path" | `MevJointProgram.mev_ge_flat_under_flair_budget_false` — a machine-checked negation. Witness `T=2`, `Δt=2`, `B=2`, `σ=(1,10)`, unit `w`/`D`, evaluated fees `(2,0)`, flat fee `1`; recomputed independently in exact rationals: flat `1/2 + 10/11 = 31/22 ≈ 1.4091` vs tilted `1/3 + 1 = 4/3 ≈ 1.3333`, so the flat path is STRICTLY WORSE | **REFUTED** — block M6b had labelled this OPEN; it is FALSE. With `σ_t` varying the summands are different convex functions and ordinary Jensen never applies |
| M6b restricted to the `Θ_φ`-reachable sub-family with σ varying | — the refutation above does not settle it: its witness schedule is σ-DECREASING, whereas every `Θ_φ`-reachable schedule is isotone (`VolInstrument.multiFee_monotone`). A second refutation carrying an explicit `multiFee` witness is the named follow-up; executor float numerics point the same way and are **not** machine-checked | **OPEN** |
| M7 the aggregate `λ_MEV := λ_ARB ⊕ λ_sandwich`, `⊕` being hazard-side (plain) addition, with the `⊗_φ` correspondence held separate; reduction `λ_sandwich = 0 ⟹ λ_MEV = λ_ARB` | `MevJointProgram.mevTotal` (`:= lamARB + lamSand`, plain addition), `mevTotal_eq_arb_of_sandwich_zero`, `mevTotal_mevMulti_eq_of_sandwich_zero`, `mevTotal_probOr_hazard` (the correspondence lemma, via `VolInstrument.probOr_hazard`) | **PROVEN** — `⊗_φ` is never applied to the unbounded hazards directly |
| M7(i) the rebate is an LP-INCIDENCE object, not a reduction in extraction: `λ_MEV^{LP-net} = (1−τ)λ_MEV`, `τ(k) = k/(k+1) ∈ [0,1)` | `MevJointProgram.mevNet`, `mevNet_le_mev` (nonnegativity DISCHARGED on `mevMulti_nonneg`, not assumed), `mevNet_anti_tau`, `mevNet_eq_zero_of_tau_one`, `mevNet_argmin_invariant` (for every `τ < 1` the rebate changes the program's VALUE and not its SOLUTION), `taxFraction`, `taxFraction_mem_Ico`, `taxFraction_mono` | **PROVEN** — `τ` sits **outside** `Θ_φ`; `k` is FREE and no numeral enters a statement, because the l2-angstrom snapshot and the live documentation disagree on the constants |
| M7(ii) the batch cadence IS `Δt`: it moves `λ_ARB` monotonically and does not enter `λ_FLAIR` at all | `MevJointProgram.mev_mono_dt` (ISOTONE in `Δt`) | **PROVEN** — the second protocol lever **outside** `Θ_φ`, alongside `τ` |

### 7.2 `## ETA` — the curvature controller and the interior η⋆: the OPEN ledger

**Where the claim rows live.** The per-block E0–E7 claim table for this layer is
**§13**, not here: it landed with the module (commit b02caf7) and follows the
convention §8 onward established, under which each later doc-block layer gets its
own top-level section. This subsection is the §7-level entry point for it and is
**not a second copy** — duplicating those statuses would create two sources of
truth for the same verdicts, which is the failure mode this file exists to prevent.
Headline carriers, for navigation only: `curvIndex` (the bijection),
`kphiStar` / `lpExcess_isMaxOn` (the interior optimum — a **KINK**, established by
two one-sided monotonicity results, **no first-order condition anywhere**),
`etaStar` / `curvIndex_etaStar` (the closed form, obtained by INVERTING a
bijection), `priceEta_eq_p_eta_half` (the exponent identity),
`eta_no_common_argmax` and `etaStar_coupled_to_fee_corner` (the cross-model
statement, NARROWED per the user's 2026-07-31 ruling).

**Do not read the headline as a duplicate of the existing `exp/` result.**
`lean/exp/DynamicsOptimization.lean` (`foc_eta`, `optimal_controls`) already carries
an interior-η claim, but in a DIFFERENT model, on a different objective, and it
**HYPOTHESIZES** the maximizer and characterizes it by a first-order condition.
What §13 adds is **CONSTRUCTION** — existence and closed form from an inversion,
with no stationarity argument. Relating the two would need exactly the factor-share
identification that item (6) below records as OPEN, so neither supersedes the other
and this file asserts no relation between them.

**The standing OPEN ledger (ETA block E8).** Every item is **OPEN**; none is a
failure and none may be quietly dropped when this layer is cited downstream.

| # | Open item | Why it is open | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The equilibrium transfer** (and the object-level identification under it) | That `curvIndex η Δi` IS the anchor's structural mixing weight `k` is a MODELLING identification, not a definition; that the tick-grid AMM's equilibrium then HAS the anchor's closed forms is ASSUMED, not derived. Every §13 theorem is about `lpExcess ∘ curvIndex`; none is about this project's AMM | **OPEN** |
| 2 | **Welfare** | Proposition 6's welfare half is not transcribed and does not follow from E3+E4 — below `kphiStar` the pieces move in opposite directions (`surplus_add_revenue_const`). The anchor's ranking also assumes arbitrage rent is deadweight, which `### MEV` contradicts under rent recycling | **OPEN** |
| 3 | **`arbLossRatio` vs `mevMulti` — NOT IDENTIFIED** | Different models, different units (§0). No identification is attempted or implied, and no row may substitute one for the other | **OPEN** (by construction, not by omission) |
| 4 | **Gas** | The anchor's Assumption 3 (the arbitrageur pays a gas fee equal to its full profit) is absorbed, not modelled | **OPEN** |
| 5 | **The `Θ_φ`-restricted σ-varying MEV comparison** — INHERITED FROM PHASE 11, untouched here | The general schedule-level claim is REFUTED (`mev_ge_flat_under_flair_budget_false`); the isotone sub-family `Θ_φ` actually reaches (`multiFee_monotone`) is not settled by that witness. **This layer does not touch it and must not appear to** (§7.1, last M6b row) | **OPEN** |
| 6 | **The factor-share identification** (`L_eta`) | T28'b came back absent, as pre-authorized. The exponent identity (`priceEta_eq_p_eta_half`) is proven algebra and is all that is claimed; the factor-share half is a modelling claim about reserves, and is *unavailable* wherever `η⋆ ∉ (0,1)`. ⟹ the user's η-identity decision is **PARTIALLY discharged** (§0) | **OPEN** |
| 7 | **The Phase-11 degeneracy is NOT resolved here** | `mevMulti` contains no η, no `κ_φ`, no `ϱ_I`, so nothing in this layer moves it. Closing it needs one objective carrying both a demand-elastic investor and `λ_ARB`; `ϱ_I` is a CANDIDATE for the §6(b) demand layer, not a closure of it | **OPEN** |
| 8 | **`η⋆` is σ-INDEXED; η is a design constant** | The fee entering `etaStar` is a fixed scalar, whereas this document's fee is `multiFee(σ)` and `φ̄` is only its FLOOR. The Phase-11 corner therefore induces `η⋆(σ)` pointwise while the grid exponent is chosen once at pool creation. Reconciling the two is not addressed — and a beforeSwap/afterSwap hook cannot vary η | **OPEN** |
| 9 | **The strict single-peakedness boundary** | Under `cOne ≤ 0` the LP payoff is flat in `κ_φ` and `etaStar` is not an argmax at all (`liquidity_freeze_minimal`, `lpPayoff_isMaxOn` are stated under `0 < cOne`); the sign of `c₁` at the fee corner is pinned by nothing in this layer | **OPEN** |

## 8. `VOL ORDER COMPLETION — ENDOGENOUS MATURITY` (doc block, issue cfmm-lean4-spec#1 → `EndogenousMaturity.lean`)

Alternates remain formalized: `tStarJointSub*` (identical on `t★ ≥ 0`, floor placement per `joint_candidates_disagree`), `tStarJointQuadratic*` (REJECTED — breaks the dated-equivalent reading, pro-holder under vol clustering) | **DECIDED → PROVEN** |

## 9. `τ_MEV ENTRY ALGEBRA` (draft blocks M9–M10, `VOLATILITY_INSTRUMENTS_TAU_ADDENDUM.md` → `TauMevAlgebra.lean`)

Three entry channels formalized; **DECIDED (user, 2026-07-31): channel (A), monoid entry** `φ_total = φ_M ⊗_φ φ_X ⊗_φ τ_MEV`. Alternates NOT adopted: (B) convex separation `(1−τ)φ / τφ` (`lpShare`/`donation`); (C) auction lump-sum = the already-proven `MevJointProgram.taxFraction`/`mevNet`. Decided consequences: λ_τ is a genuine ⊕-summand; strict intensity effect (λ_ARB ↓); no leg-targeting; no compensation routed (donation would require an ORDER-SENSITIVE hybrid with (B)/(C)); φ⊗τ moves the M6a level direction.

| G1 aggregate flat dollar gamma `Γ^Σp²` — GRID-EXACT; band-modulated companion `∝ p^{1/2}` (pointwise const is FALSE) | `varswapWeight_geometric`, `logContractLiquidity_geometric` (the proven grid-level statements) | **PROVEN** (grid level) / **CORRECTED** (pointwise claim) |
| G1 `υ = t/2` vs locked-LP short vega `−(t★−t)/8·(asset leg)`; t-semantics clause (maturity param vs calendar) | `variancePortfolio_upsilon`, `tStar`, `tStarFunded` | **PROVEN** (υ) / spec (locked vega) |
| G1 both θ_fee forms: schedule-level `φ(σ_t)ν_t` (M6b-commensurable, what λ_FLAIR sums) and position-level `φ(σ_t)ν_tΔQ_M` | `VolInstrument.multiFee`, `FlairOptimization.flairHazard` | **UNFORMALIZED** — the future Aristotle statement MUST name which form |
| G2 depth/emission Greeks `𝒟_{L̄}[C]`, `𝒟_{ΔQ_M}[C]` = **CALL** Greeks (Maymin Def 2); LP-side composition `𝒟_{L̄}[π] ≥ 0` (opposite sign to the first draft) | — | **OFF-BUNDLE** (CEV pricing, noncentral χ², IV inversion beyond Mathlib v4.28) |

| G3 CONTROL MATRIX (8 parameter blocks × 11 rows, position-level): shape Greeks fee-FREE ⟹ `(ξ,ι)` the shaping base; **`(β_j,γ_j)` control the CARRY PROFILE** via `Δθ_fee/Δσ = u Σ α_j γ_j Λ′(γ_j(σ−β_j))·ν_t` — β translates, γ scales where carry accrues in σ-space | `VolInstrument.multiFee` (the derivative structure verified against the def), `multiFee_monotone`, `multiFee_bounds` | **SPEC** — the first first-order display containing the shape block (cf. T24, J8 negative results) |
| G3 caveats: the carry static holds at FIXED `(φ̄,α,u)` — moving `(β,γ)` re-prices λ_FLAIR (weights `W_j` depend on them; β→−∞ never attained); the vega "hedge" needs the TIME-INTEGRATED `∫_t^{t★}` form (level-vega vs rate-vega) | `FlairOptimization` corner lemmas | **CORRECTED** (both over-claims caught at gate) |

| G5 EVM partition (exact / approximable / off-chain); `σ²(i(t))` needs an oracle hook or a new accumulator (E2/E5 feed the OFF-chain subgraph) | events layer | **SPEC** |

Gate: Reality Checker + Model QA, both NEEDS WORK → 3 BLOCKERs + 7 MAJORs resolved (commit 2460f7f). Key corrections: Maymin's Λ/E are call Greeks not LP Greeks (LP-side sign was asserted backwards); **η_L = 1 − w** (his CEV exponent is the NUMERAIRE weight — decided against his asymmetric eq (12), invisible at the w = ½ point where all specializations sit); Clark's delta display is UNNUMBERED (gamma = eq (12); eq (13) is Green–Jarrow spanning — never cite it for a Greek).

## 12. `τ_JIT — THE LIQUIDITY TAX` (block J9 → `TauJit.lean`; Aristotle project `4cb6d5ca`)

DECIDED (user, 2026-07-31): `(β,γ)` DISCARDED for JIT control; the control is `τ_JIT`, a tax on JIT liquidity provision. 25 declarations, all axiom-clean, 15 deps byte-identical.

| Doc claim | Lean | Status |
|---|---|---|
| J9 taxed payoff `u_J^τ = u_J − τ_JIT·(add+rm)`, l2-angstrom rate instance `x/(x+1)` | `uJtax`, `uJtax_jitRate`, `uJtax_strict_decrease`, `uJtax_additivity` | **PROVEN** |
| J9 the STRUCTURAL ASYMMETRY vs `τ_MEV`: liquidity carries no fee ⟹ NO monoid/split algebra exists | `uJtax_not_probOr_factor` — **no unary `f` makes the levy factor through `probOr`**; two-point witness `(1,0)`/`(0,1)`, equal `probOr = 1`, taxed payoffs `1` vs `−base` | **PROVEN** (impossibility) |

| J9 REMEDY DIRECTION `∂ζ★/∂τ_JIT ≤ 0 ?` — answered in discrete form | `crowdingActive`, `gatedVolume`, `gatedVolume_eq_baseline_of_tauStar_lt`, `crowdingActive_antitone_tau`, and the headline contrast `tax_shrinks_while_fee_widens`: the tax weakly SHRINKS the crowding-active set while `ζstar` strictly WIDENS in the trader fee (reuses `JitLiquidity.trader_fee_raises_crowding_threshold`) | **PROVEN** — the tax is the correct remedy channel exactly where fee-raising backfires |
| J9 `τ_JIT ≠ ϑ` (tax prices the event; the split redistributes income) | `split_payoff_pos`, `split_positive_tax_negative_witness` — witness `u_J = s_J = base = 1`, `τ_JIT = 2`: split payoff `> 0` for EVERY `ϑ ∈ (0,1]` while taxed payoff `= −1` | **PROVEN** (inequivalence) |

## 13. `ETA — THE INTERIOR CURVATURE CONTROLLER` (blocks E0–E8 → `EtaCurvature.lean`; projects `4878ca32` + repair `c3a617f3`)

Notation: curvature `κ_{\varphi}` (Capponi's `k`; Lean `curvIndex`, branch points `kphiS`/`kphiI`, kink `kphiStar`); `ϱ_S`/`ϱ_I` = Capponi's `α`/`β`; `c₁,c₂,c₃` = his `τ₁,τ₂,τ₃` (τ is τ_MEV). 51 declarations, all axiom-clean, 18 deps byte-identical across BOTH runs.

| Doc claim | Lean | Status |
|---|---|---|

| E2/E3 Lemma 3(1)/(2): both branches, branch points, continuity, strict antitonicity | `arbLossRatio_branch_agree`, `arbLossRatio_strictAntiOn`, `arbLossRatio_pos`, `kphiS_mem_Ioo`, `kphiS_eq_zero_of_eq`, `arbLossRatio_eq_zero_of_kphiS_eq_zero`, `surplusRatio_strictAntiOn`, `kphiS_le_kphiI_iff` | **PROVEN** — `kphiS_eq_zero_of_eq` is the honest replacement for the FALSE-as-drafted `arbLossRatio_eq_zero_of_fee_ge` (the ϖ_A occurrence indicator is frozen into a constant and cannot express Lemma 1's zero-loss) |
| E4 **THE INTERIOR OPTIMUM** `κ_φ⋆ = κ_{φ,I} = 1 − √((1+φ)/(1+ϱ_I))`, interior ⟺ `φ < ϱ_I`; a KINK, no FOC | `lpExcess_strictMonoOn`, `lpExcess_strictAntiOn`, `lpExcess_isMaxOn`, `kphiStar_eq_kphiI`, `kphiStar_mem_Ioo_iff`, `lpPayoff_isMaxOn`, `liquidity_freeze_minimal`, branch agreements at both points | **PROVEN** — the maximum comes from TWO ONE-SIDED monotonicity results; no stationarity argument anywhere |

| E6 **THE HEADLINE** `η⋆ = ln((1+ϱ_I)/(1+φ))/(Δi²·ln λ)` with `κ_φ(η⋆) = κ_φ⋆`; comparative statics; the η-side transport | `curvIndex_etaStar`, `etaStar_pos_iff`, `etaStar_strictMono_premInv`, `etaStar_strictAnti_fee`, `etaStar_strictAnti_spacing`, `lpExcessEta_isMaxOn`, `lpExcessEta_strictMonoOn`, `lpExcessEta_strictAntiOn` | **PROVEN** |

| E6 η-identity claim (ii), the FACTOR-SHARE half (`L_eta = X^η Y^{1−η}`) | — (T28'b absent, pre-authorized; NOT satisfied by restating T28'a) | **OPEN** (E8(6)) — and *unavailable* wherever `η⋆ ∉ (0,1)`: at `λ=1.0001, ϱ_I=0.05, φ=0.003`, `η⋆ ≈ 458/Δi²` |
| E7 the cross-model statement + the fee/curvature coupling `∂η⋆/∂φ < 0` | `eta_no_common_argmax`, `etaStar_coupled_to_fee_corner` | **PROVEN as NARROWED** (user ruling 2026-07-31): NO literal de-degeneration of the `Θ_φ` program — `mevMulti` contains no η, no κ_φ, no ϱ_I. The interior optimum lives in the Capponi-anchored model; Phase-11's degeneracy stands where it was left (E8(3): the two arbitrage objects are NOT identified) |
| E7 scalarization-impossibility as first drafted | — **FALSE beyond the first branch**: arbLoss and surplus switch branches at DIFFERENT points (`κ_{φ,S} < κ_{φ,I}`), so the weighted sum crosses zero at `κ_φ ≈ 0.2412 ∈ (0.1835, 0.5)`, no branch point | **CORRECTED in the doc 2026-07-31**; the false form was PROHIBITED in the prompt and never entered Lean |

Fidelity: 13/15 repaired statements verbatim; 2 AMENDED with added hypotheses and conclusions intact — `lpExcess_strictAntiOn` gains E0's own ordering `φ < ϱ_S ≤ ϱ_I`, and `etaStar_pos_iff` gains `−1 < ϱ_I` because **Mathlib's `Real.log` is `log|x|`** (witness `ϱ_I = −3, φ = 0`), precisely the log-sign trap the 12-02 Model QA review predicted. Zero narrowed statements. Full record: `.planning/phases/12-eta-tradeoff-optimum/12-03-FIDELITY.md`.

**The nine standing OPEN items of block E8 are NOT in the table above — they are the
ledger in §7.2**, together with the §7-level entry point for this layer and the
statement that this layer neither duplicates nor supersedes
`exp/DynamicsOptimization`. Cite this section and that ledger together; the claim
rows alone overstate the layer's reach.

## 14. `ε_{X/M} — THE SUBSTITUTION ELASTICITY` (blocks S0–S3 → `EtaTilde.lean`; project `67b1c841`)

Doc symbol `ε_{X/M}` (the trading-curve exponent, user decision 2026-08-02) ↔ Lean `etaTilde` (name fixed by the bundle, submitted before the rename; a proven file is never hand-edited — same doc-glyph/Lean-name split as `ℙ_{Δ_ARB}`↔`ptrade`). 23 declarations, all axiom-clean, 20 deps byte-identical.

**η and ε_{X/M} are DISTINCT parameters on distinct objects** — η indexes the price grid `p_{(η,Δi)}`, ε_{X/M} the trading curve `φ_{ε}`. This module proves the BRIDGE between them; it does not identify them.

| Doc claim | Lean | Status |

| S2 curvature **strictly DECREASING** in the asset share (as drafted) | `not_curvOfTilde_strictAnti` — machine-checked negation, witness `Δi = 1`, shares `1/4 < 3/4` with curvatures in INCREASING order | **REFUTED** |

| S3 `curvIndex ∈ (0,1)` exactly on the asset-heavy half `ε ∈ (½,1)` | `curvOfTilde_mem_Ioo` — the `t ∈ (0,1)` hypothesis is NECESSARY (`Real.rpow` uses `log|x|` outside it) | **PROVEN** (hypothesis added, declared) |
| S3 domain coincidence `0 < ηΔi ⟺ ε > ½ ⟺ κ_φ ∈ (0,1)`; and `η = 0 ⟺ ε = ½ ⟺ κ_φ = 0` | `admissible_iff`, `zero_curv_iff` | **PROVEN** — the first condition is exactly `VolInstrument.deltaQM_nonneg`'s hypothesis, recovered as an economic condition |
| E8(6) consequence: the induced share at the landed optimum is in `(0,1)` UNCONDITIONALLY, and `κ_φ⋆` factors through it | `etaStar_tilde_mem_Ioo`, `curvIndex_etaStar_via_tilde` | **PROVEN** — the factor-share reading is reachable through `ε`, not through `η` (which can be ≈458) |

Fidelity: 22/23 as requested; **1 REFUTED with its correction proven under a different name** (the C4 direction), exactly the sanctioned outcome. One hypothesis added and declared (`curvOfTilde_mem_Ioo`'s `t ∈ (0,1)`, the `Real.log`-is-`log|x|` trap for the third time in this program).

## 15. `φ_{ε,ρ} — THE CES LOCK` (the φ convention → `PhiCES.lean`; project `cd3558f7`)

`phiCES ρ ε x y := (ε x^ρ + (1−ε) y^ρ)^{1/ρ}`. 12 declarations, all axiom-clean, 21 deps byte-identical. Doc symbol `φ_{ε,ρ}`; the doc's ρ = 0 branch is a DEFINED case (Cobb–Douglas), never an evaluation of the bracket.

| Doc claim | Lean | Status |
|---|---|---|
| homogeneity degree 1, positivity, monotonicity in each leg | `phiCES_homogeneous`, `phiCES_pos`, `phiCES_mono` | **PROVEN** |
| concavity for ρ ≤ 1 | `phiCES_concave` — **RADIAL concavity only**, explicitly labelled "not a claim of full joint concavity in (x,y)" | **NARROWED, DECLARED** — joint concavity remains OPEN |

| ρ = 1 gives the linear form | `phiCES_one` | **PROVEN** |

| ε and ρ are ORTHOGONAL axes — moving ρ is not moving ε | `phiCES_rho_ne_eps_axis` — two-point refutation: no ε′ makes the ρ = −1 (harmonic) slice match the ρ = 1 equal-share member at both `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` | **PROVEN** (as a refutation) |
| the two families meet only at the CPMM | `phiCES_agreement_point` — sharp at the evaluation point `(4,1)`: `4^ε = √4 ↔ ε = ½`; docstring states it is an evaluation-level uniqueness, NOT a turning of the undefined ρ=0 formula into a value | **PROVEN** (evaluation form, scope declared) |
| the landed `curvIndex` is the ρ = 0 slice — it carries no independent ρ | `curvIndex_is_rho_zero_slice` (via `tildeOfCurv_curvOfTilde`) | **PROVEN** ⟹ `curvIndex` CANNOT represent Capponi's κ, which varies along ρ |
| relation of `ρ` to `exp/CESLongVolPayoff`'s η | `phiCES_rho_vs_pi_eta_trader` — `1/(1−ρ) = 1/(1−η) ↔ ρ = η` away from the poles, and `q = p − 1`. Docstring: "only an algebraic conditional: it does NOT identify the payoff parameter with the trading-function parameter" | **CONDITIONAL** — E8(6) untouched |

Fidelity: 12/12 targets returned; **1 deliberately narrowed and declared** (radial not joint concavity), **1 returned as the requested refutation** (orthogonality), **1 returned as a conditional rather than an identification** (ρ vs exp's η) — the prompt forbade assuming it and the prover honoured that.

## 16. `F → φ, THE CANONICAL TRANSITION` (E1 / the "F is φ" claim → `CanonicalCurve.lean`; project `ffdb83fe`)

Mechanism: Angeris–Chitra–Diamandis–Evans–Kulkarni, *The Geometry of CFMMs*, arXiv:2308.08066 §1.3.2 eq (6) — `canon ψ k R = sup{λ > 0 | ψ(R/λ) ≥ k}`, the canonical trading function, nondecreasing/concave/homogeneous. PDF: `plank/refs/cfmm/angeris-geometry_of_cfmms-2023.pdf`. 16 declarations, all axiom-clean, 21 deps byte-identical.

| Doc claim | Lean | Status |
|---|---|---|

| Capponi's `F_κ` canonicalizes to the quadratic positive root `(b + √(b² + 4Cκxy))/(2C)`, `b = (1−κ)A·L` | `canon_Fcap`, `canon_Fcap_homogeneous` | **PROVEN** |
| endpoints: `κ = 1` → `√(xy)/√C`; `κ = 0` → `A·L/C` (linear) | `canon_Fcap_one`, `canon_Fcap_zero` | **PROVEN** |
| **the agreement**: at `κ = 1` the canonical form IS `φ_{1/2}` up to a positive scalar | `canon_Fcap_one_eq_phiEps_half` | **PROVEN** |
| "F is φ" as a FAMILY identity | `canon_Fcap_not_phiEps` — for `κ ∈ (0,1)` there is no `(ε, c > 0)` with `canon(F_κ) = c·φ_ε` pointwise | **REFUTED** |
| `F_0 = φ_{ε(κ_φ = 0)}` (the naive substitution the doc's E1 note proposed) | `tildeOfCurv_zero` (`= 1/2`), `linear_not_phiEps_half`, and **`curvIndex_orientation_inconsistent`** | **REFUTED** — the linear endpoint is not a positive multiple of `φ_{1/2}`; the composite identification fails at zero |
| where the two indices actually agree | `cpmm_sits_at_curvIndex_zero` — a CONJUNCTION: the identification HOLDS at Capponi `κ = 1` and FAILS at `κ = 0`, so any identification respecting the agreement point must REVERSE orientation | **PROVEN** |
| numeraire-relative prices (`p_B = 1`, `p_A = p²`) | `canon_Fcap_numeraire` | **PROVEN** |

**Reading.** "F is φ" survives as a CANONICAL-FORM statement and at ONE point (the CPMM, Capponi `κ = 1` ⟺ our `κ_φ = 0`), and is refuted as a family identity and at the linear endpoint. Combined with §15's `curvIndex_is_rho_zero_slice`, the diagnosis is complete: Capponi's `κ` travels the `ρ` axis of `φ_{ε,ρ}`, our `κ_φ` is a function of the share `ε` alone, and the two coincide only where both axes sit at base values. **E8(1) remains OPEN and is now open for a precise reason rather than a vague one.**

## 17. `κ(ρ) — THE GENUINE CURVATURE INDEX, AND WHAT κ_φ ACTUALLY MEASURES` (→ `CurvatureTwo.lean`; project `22153d1d`)

18 declarations, all axiom-clean, 23 deps byte-identical. **The headline is a REFUTATION of this project's own naming.**

| Claim | Lean | Status |
|---|---|---|
| marginal price of `phiCES`, and its Cobb–Douglas limit | `margPrice`, `margPrice_pos`, `margPrice_rho_zero_limit` | **PROVEN** |
| substitution elasticity `1/(1−ρ)`: strictly monotone on `Iio 1`, `= 1` at ρ=0 (Cobb–Douglas), `→ ∞` as ρ→1⁻ (perfect substitutes) | `subElast`, `subElast_strictMonoOn_Iio`, `subElast_zero`, `subElast_tendsto_one` | **PROVEN** |
| a GENUINE curvature index `curvTwo ρ = (1−ρ)/(2−ρ)` — zero at the linear member, strictly positive below it, strictly antitone in ρ, valued in `[0,1)` | `curvTwo`, `curvTwo_linear_zero`, `curvTwo_pos_of_lt_one`, `curvTwo_strictAnti_rho`, `curvTwo_mem_Ico` | **PROVEN** — **ε and Δi are INERT in it** (declared in the docstring: they encode share and grid scale, not substitution curvature) |
| **is the landed `curvOfTilde` a curvature?** | **`curvOfTilde_not_curvature`** — NO. `curvOfTilde (1/2) = 0`, but the equal-share ρ→0 member is the CONSTANT-PRODUCT curve (`phiCES_zero_half_eq_geom`), which differs from the equal-share LINEAR member already at reserves `(1,4)`; `curvTwo` separates them as `1/2` vs `0`. No strictly monotone zero-preserving `f` can reconcile them | **REFUTED** — `curvOfTilde` measures **SHARE ASYMMETRY / GRID TILT, not CES substitution curvature** |
| the design dial: invert curvature to the substitution exponent | `rhoOfCurv c = (1−2c)/(1−c)`, `curvTwo_rhoOfCurv`, `rhoOfCurv_curvTwo` (both round trips), `rhoOfCurv_strictAnti` | **PROVEN** |

**Consequence for the doc.** The symbol `κ_{\varphi}` as used in E1–E7 and proven in `EtaCurvature`/`EtaTilde` is NOT a curvature index; it is a share-asymmetry index. Every E-block result about it stands as mathematics — nothing is invalidated — but the NAME is wrong, and the identification with Capponi's mixing weight `κ` fails for this reason and not merely for the orientation reason recorded in §16. The genuine curvature is `curvTwo`, a function of ρ ALONE, and its inversion `rhoOfCurv` is the design dial: choose a target curvature, get the substitution exponent.
